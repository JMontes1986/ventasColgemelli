# **App Name**: Ventas ColGemelli

## Core Features:

- Ticket Issuance: Generate individual tickets with unique codes and QR codes, ensuring each ticket is marked as 'available' upon creation. Use the 'issueTicket' Cloud Function tool.
- Sales Recording: Record sales transactions by creating orders, associating tickets with the order, calculating totals, and validating ticket availability using a Cloud Function to ensure atomicity.
- Payment Confirmation: Register payments, update order statuses to 'paid,' and finalize ticket status using a Cloud Function, linking payment records to specific orders.
- Ticket Redemption: Validate QR codes to redeem tickets, updating the ticket status to 'redeemed' and creating audit logs for tracking.
- Cashbox Management: Enable opening and closing of cashboxes with consolidated totals and audit logging using Cloud Functions.
- User Role Management: Administer user roles (admin, cashier, seller, auditor, readonly) by assigning custom claims to users for permission control using a Cloud Function.
- Auditing: Automatically maintains an audit log related to sensitive transactions, such as when tickets are issued, marked as sold, marked as void, or cashed in. The logs include the user who initiated the action as well as timestamps for further forensic analysis.
- Self-Service Purchase: Allow parents to purchase tickets online, generating a unique code for verification. Redirect them to the school's Daviplata application for payment. After payment, allow them to authorize the purchase and claim the tickets at the box office.
